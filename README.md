# EcCalculation
Code backup for calculating 30min fluxes from eddy covariance measurement
Code can be splited into
# part 1 preprocessing #
Read data -> Despike -> Gapfilling -> Save as nc file
# part 2 calculation #
Coordinate rotation -> Spectral Correction -> SND correction -> WPL correction -> Flux calculation and spectral analysis
# part 3 postprocessing #
Quality control -> plot
